Understanding Credit Card Fraud:
What is Credit Card Fraud?
According to an article written by Debra E. Ross,“Credit card fraud, act committed by any person who, with intent to defraud,uses a credit card that has been revoked, cancelled, reported lost, or stolen to obtain anything of value.”
Fraud can be defined as an unlawful action which is intentional in nature for personal gain. A fraud done by someone without the knowledge of the card holder is termed as ‘third-party fraud’ whereas a fraud done by the card holder himself is termed as ‘first-party fraud’. A common belief is that a fraud is mostly carried out by third-party and not first party; but this is not true. As per Experian fraud statistics the ratio of first- and third-party frauds are nearly equal.
The Challenge of the CASE

Scenario of the Case:
In this particular case, KPMG in India had to design an anomaly detection system for the authorization cycle which is capable of handling and processing approximately >100 transactions per second, considering the time limit on each transaction process is 300 milli seconds. This product had to be deployed in the FDS of the issuer bank and had to run in parallel with the misuse or rule basesystem.
